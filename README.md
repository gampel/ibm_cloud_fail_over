# IBM Cloud Fail Over Functions


## Overview

IBM Cloud Fail Over is a Python module designed to automate failover processes for applications hosted on IBM Cloud. This module provides essential functions to manage failover scenarios effectively, ensuring high availability and reliability.

## Features

- **Automated Failover**: Seamlessly switch to backup resources when primary resources are unavailable.
- **Resource Management**: Manage critical resources like Virtual IPs and Floating IPs with ease.

## Installation

You can install the IBM Cloud Fail Over module using pip. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install ibm_cloud_fail_over
```

## Usage

### Main Functions

#### `fail_over_cr_vip`

This function manages the failover of a Cloud Resource Virtual IP (CR VIP).

**Usage:**

```python
from ibm_cloud_fail_over import fail_over_cr_vip

# Example usage
result = fail_over_cr_vip(primary_vip='your_primary_vip', secondary_vip='your_secondary_vip')
print(result)
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter          | Type   | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `primary_vip`      | str    | The primary Virtual IP to monitor.               |
| `secondary_vip`    | str    | The secondary Virtual IP to switch to.           |

**Returns:**

- A confirmation message indicating the success or failure of the failover operation.

#### `fail_over_floating_ip`

This function manages the failover of a Floating IP.

**Usage:**

```python
from ibm_cloud_fail_over import fail_over_floating_ip

# Example usage
result = fail_over_floating_ip(primary_ip='your_primary_ip', secondary_ip='your_secondary_ip')
print(result)
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter          | Type   | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `primary_ip`       | str    | The primary Floating IP to monitor.              |
| `secondary_ip`     | str    | The secondary Floating IP to switch to.          |

**Returns:**

- A confirmation message indicating the success or failure of the failover operation.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the module, consider the following:

- **Invalid IP Addresses**: Ensure that the IP addresses provided for primary and secondary resources are valid and reachable.
- **Network Issues**: Check your network connectivity to the IBM Cloud resources.
- **Permissions**: Ensure that your IBM Cloud account has the necessary permissions to manage the specified resources.
